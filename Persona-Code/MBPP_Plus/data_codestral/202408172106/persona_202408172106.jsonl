They would then use this understanding to develop a logical and efficient algorithm for finding the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n.

It then iterates through the list, updating the maximum sum at each index if a larger sum is found. If the kth element is reached, it adds the ith element to the sum.

Understand the problem: The task is to determine whether the product of all numbers in a list is even or not.\n2. Identify the key concept: Even numbers are those that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder.\n3. Develop a plan: Iterate through the list, multiplying all the numbers together.
