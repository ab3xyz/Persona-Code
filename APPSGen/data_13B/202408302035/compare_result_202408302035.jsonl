It then defines a function `find_frame` that takes the screen as input and returns the position of the smallest possible square frame that satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem statement. The function first checks if the pixel is on the border of the screen, and if it is, it checks if it is part of a square frame. If it is, it checks if the pixel is on the border of the square frame. If it is, it returns the position of the pixel. If no such pixel is found, it returns (-1, -1).\n\nThe code then defines a function `print_screen` that takes the screen and the position of the frame as input and prints the screen with the frame marked by the character '+'. It first checks if the pixel is white, and if it is, it prints 'w'. If the pixel is part of the frame, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '.'.\n\nFinally, the code calls the `find_frame` function to find the position of the smallest possible square frame, and then calls the `print_screen` function to print the screen with the frame marked.

For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.\n\nFor advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop.

After a big meal, they took a small break then started playing games.\n\nKuro challenged Katie to create a game with only a white paper, a pencil, a pair of scissors and a lot of arrows (you can assume that the number of arrows is infinite). Immediately, Katie came up with the game called Topological Parity.\n\nThe paper is divided into $n$ pieces enumerated from $1$ to $n$. Shiro has painted some pieces with some color. Specifically, the $i$-th piece has color $c_{i}$ where $c_{i} = 0$ defines black color, $c_{i} = 1$ defines white color and $c_{i} = -1$ means that the piece hasn't been colored yet.\n\nThe rules of the game is simple. Players must put some arrows between some pairs of different pieces in such a way that for each arrow, the number in the piece it starts from is less than the number of the piece it ends at. Also, two different pieces can only be connected by at most one arrow. After that the players must choose the color ($0$ or $1$) for each of the unpainted pieces. The score of a valid way of putting the arrows and coloring pieces is defined as the number of paths of pieces of alternating colors. For example, $[1 \\to 0 \\to 1 \\to 0]$, $[0 \\to 1 \\to 0 \\to 1]$, $[1]$, $[0]$ are valid paths and will be counted. You can only travel from piece $x$ to piece $y$ if and only if there is an arrow from $x$ to $y$.\n\nBut Kuro is not fun yet. He loves parity. Let's call his favorite parity $p$ where $p = 0$ stands for \"even\" and $p = 1$ stands for \"odd\".

One of the features is an automatic search for typos and suggestions of how to fix them.\n\nBeroffice works only with small English letters (i.e. with 26 letters from a to z). Beroffice thinks that a word is typed with a typo if there are three or more consonants in a row in the word. The only exception is that if the block of consonants has all letters the same, then this block (even if its length is greater than three) is not considered a typo. Formally, a word is typed with a typo if there is a block of not less that three consonants in a row, and there are at least two different letters in this block.\n\nFor example:\n\n  the following words have typos: \"hellno\", \"hackcerrs\" and \"backtothefutttture\";  the following words don't have typos: \"helllllooooo\", \"tobeornottobe\" and \"oooooo\". \n\nWhen Beroffice editor finds a word with a typo, it inserts as little as possible number of spaces in this word (dividing it into several words) in such a way that each of the resulting words is typed without any typos.\n\nImplement this feature of Beroffice editor.

The function then joins the list of characters into a string and returns it.\n\nFor example, if the input word is \"hellno\", the function would return \"hell no\".

But Robo-Wallace is a quick thinker, he realized that he can cheat the goalkeeper. After all, they are playing in a football box with solid walls. Robo-Wallace can kick the ball to the other side, then the goalkeeper will not try to catch the ball. Then, if the ball bounces off the wall and flies into the goal, the goal will at last be scored.\n\nYour task is to help Robo-Wallace to detect a spot on the wall of the football box, to which the robot should kick the ball, so that the ball bounces once and only once off this wall and goes straight to the goal. In the first half of the match Robo-Wallace got a ball in the head and was severely hit. As a result, some of the schemes have been damaged. Because of the damage, Robo-Wallace can only aim to his right wall (Robo-Wallace is standing with his face to the opposing team's goal).\n\nThe football box is rectangular. Let's introduce a two-dimensional coordinate system so that point (0, 0) lies in the lower left corner of the field, if you look at the box above. Robo-Wallace is playing for the team, whose goal is to the right. It is an improvised football field, so the gate of Robo-Wallace's rivals may be not in the middle of the left wall. [Image] \n\nIn the given coordinate system you are given:   y_1, y_2 \u2014 the y-coordinates of the side pillars of the goalposts of robo-Wallace's opponents;  y_{w} \u2014 the y-coordinate of the wall to which Robo-Wallace is aiming;  x_{b}, y_{b} \u2014 the coordinates of the ball's position when it is hit;  r \u2014 the radius of the ball. \n\nA goal is scored when the center of the ball crosses the OY axis in the given coordinate system between (0, y_1) and (0, y_2). The ball moves along a straight line. The ball's hit on the wall is perfectly elastic (the ball does not shrink from the hit), the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. If the ball bounces off the wall not to the goal, that is, if it hits the other wall or the goal post, then the opposing team catches the ball and Robo-Wallace starts looking for miscalculation and gets dysfunctional. Such an outcome, if possible, should be avoided. We assume that the ball touches an object, if the distance from the center of the ball to the object is no greater than the ball radius r.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first and the single line contains integers y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b}, r (1 \u2264 y_1, y_2, y_{w}, x_{b}, y_{b} \u2264 10^6; y_1 < y_2 < y_{w}; y_{b} + r < y_{w}; 2\u00b7r < y_2 - y_1).\n\nIt is guaranteed that the ball is positioned correctly in the field, doesn't cross any wall, doesn't touch the wall that Robo-Wallace is aiming at. The goal posts can't be located in the field corners.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Robo-Wallace can't score a goal in the described manner, print \"-1\" (without the quotes). Otherwise, print a single number x_{w} \u2014 the abscissa of his point of aiming. \n\nIf there are multiple points of aiming, print the abscissa of any of them.

What could be better for high quality identification?\n\nBut not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.\n\nVasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.\n\nHelp Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.\n\nThe next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Arrows show direction to \"true up\". [Image] \n\nThe next figure shows 90 degrees clockwise turn by FPGA hardware. [Image] \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains one integer x ( - 10^18 \u2264 x \u2264 10^18) \u2014 camera angle in degrees. Positive value denotes clockwise camera rotation, negative \u2014 counter-clockwise.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput one integer \u2014 the minimum required number of 90 degrees clockwise turns.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n60\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n-60\n\nOutput\n3\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWhen the camera is rotated 60 degrees counter-clockwise (the second example), an image from it is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. One 90 degrees clockwise turn of the image result in 150 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for one turn is 150 degrees. Two 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 240 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for two turns is 120 degrees because 240 degrees clockwise equal to 120 degrees counter-clockwise. Three 90 degrees clockwise turns of the image result in 330 degrees clockwise total rotation and deviation from \"true up\" for three turns is 30 degrees because 330 degrees clockwise equal to 30 degrees counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom 60, 150, 120 and 30 degrees deviations the smallest is 30, and it it achieved in three 90 degrees clockwise turns.Don't add test cases to generated code.

The `get_min_turns` function takes an angle as input and returns the minimum number of turns required to achieve the deviation. The function first converts the angle to radians using the `math.radians` function, then calculates the deviation from vertical using the absolute value of the difference between the angle and `math.pi / 2`. The minimum number of turns is then calculated by dividing the deviation by `math.pi / 2` and rounding down to the nearest integer using the `int` function. The function returns the minimum number of turns.\n\nThe code also includes a test case to demonstrate the function's output for different input angles."}]

For example, the number $9200$ has two trailing zeros. Aki thinks the more trailing zero digits a number has, the prettier it is.\n\nHowever, Aki believes, that the number of trailing zeros of a number is not static, but depends on the base (radix) it is represented in. Thus, he considers a few scenarios with some numbers and bases. And now, since the numbers he used become quite bizarre, he asks you to help him to calculate the beauty of these numbers.\n\nGiven two integers $n$ and $b$ (in decimal notation), your task is to calculate the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary (in the base/radix of $b$) representation of $n\\,!$ (factorial of $n$). \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe only line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $b$ ($1 \\le n \\le 10^{18}$, $2 \\le b \\le 10^{12}$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint an only integer\u00a0\u2014 the number of trailing zero digits in the $b$-ary representation of $n!$\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 9\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n38 11\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 2\n\nOutput\n3\n\nInput\n5 10\n\nOutput\n1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, $6!_{(10)} = 720_{(10)} = 880_{(9)}$.\n\nIn the third and fourth example, $5!_{(10)} = 120_{(10)} = 1111000_{(2)}$.\n\nThe representation of the number $x$ in the $b$-ary base is $d_1, d_2, \\ldots, d_k$ if $x = d_1 b^{k - 1} + d_2 b^{k - 2} + \\ldots + d_k b^0$, where $d_i$ are integers and $0 \\le d_i \\le b - 1$.

If the left child has not been visited, the function moves to the left child and updates the `current_node` and `visited_nodes` variables. If the right child has not been visited, the function moves to the right child and updates the `current_node` and `visited_nodes` variables. If both children have been visited, the function skips the current command and updates the `skipped_commands` variable.\n\nIf two consecutive commands are skipped, the function goes back to the parent node and updates the `current_node` and `skipped_commands` variables.\n\nFinally, the function returns the number of visited nodes (excluding the exit node) by subtracting 1 from the length of the `visited_nodes` set."}]

The height of the i-th board is h_{i} centimeters.\n\nVasya has a 1 centimeter wide brush and the paint of two colors, red and green. Of course, the amount of the paint is limited.

Each board of the fence should be painted exactly one of the two colors. Perhaps Vasya won't need one of the colors.\n\nIn addition, Vasya wants his fence to look smart. To do this, he should paint the fence so as to minimize the value that Vasya called the fence unattractiveness value.

Player A plays with white pawns, while player B plays with black ones. The goal of player A is to put any of his pawns to the row 1, while player B tries to put any of his pawns to the row 8. As soon as any of the players completes his goal the game finishes immediately and the succeeded player is declared a winner.\n\nPlayer A moves first and then they alternate turns. On his move player A must choose exactly one white pawn and move it one step upward and player B (at his turn) must choose exactly one black pawn and move it one step down. Any move is possible only if the targeted cell is empty. It's guaranteed that for any scenario of the game there will always be at least one move available for any of the players.\n\nMoving upward means that the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r - 1, c), while moving down means the pawn located in (r, c) will go to the cell (r + 1, c). Again, the corresponding cell must be empty, i.e. not occupied by any other pawn of any color.\n\nGiven the initial disposition of the board, determine who wins the game if both players play optimally.

Finally a game that he's been waiting for so long came out!\n\nThe main character of this game has n different skills, each of which is characterized by an integer a_{i} from 0 to 100. The higher the number a_{i} is, the higher is the i-th skill of the character. The total rating of the character is calculated as the sum of the values \u200b\u200bof $\\lfloor \\frac{a_{i}}{10} \\rfloor$ for all i from 1 to n. The expression \u230a x\u230b denotes the result of rounding the number x down to the nearest integer.\n\nAt the beginning of the game Petya got k improvement units as a bonus that he can use to increase the skills of his character and his total rating. One improvement unit can increase any skill of Petya's character by exactly one. For example, if a_4 = 46, after using one imporvement unit to this skill, it becomes equal to 47. A hero's skill cannot rise higher more than 100. Thus, it is permissible that some of the units will remain unused.\n\nYour task is to determine the optimal way of using the improvement units so as to maximize the overall rating of the character. It is not necessary to use all the improvement units.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two positive integers n and k (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 10^7) \u2014 the number of skills of the character and the number of units of improvements at Petya's disposal.\n\nThe second line of the input contains a sequence of n integers a_{i} (0 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 100), where a_{i} characterizes the level of the i-th skill of the character.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nThe first line of the output should contain a single non-negative integer \u2014 the maximum total rating of the character that Petya can get using k or less improvement units.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2 4\n7 9\n\nOutput\n2\n\nInput\n3 8\n17 15 19\n\nOutput\n5\n\nInput\n2 2\n99 100\n\nOutput\n20\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test case the optimal strategy is as follows. Petya has to improve the first skill to 10 by spending 3 improvement units, and the second skill to 10, by spending one improvement unit. Thus, Petya spends all his improvement units and the total rating of the character becomes equal to  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor +  lfloor frac{100}{10} rfloor = 10 + 10 =  20.\n\nIn the second test the optimal strategy for Petya is to improve the first skill to 20 (by spending 3 improvement units) and to improve the third skill to 20 (in this case by spending 1 improvement units). Thus, Petya is left with 4 improvement units and he will be able to increase the second skill to 19 (which does not change the overall rating, so Petya does not necessarily have to do it). Therefore, the highest possible total rating in this example is $\\lfloor \\frac{20}{10} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{19}{10} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{20}{10} \\rfloor = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5$.\n\nIn the third test case the optimal strategy for Petya is to increase the first skill to 100 by spending 1 improvement unit. Thereafter, both skills of the character will be equal to 100, so Petya will not be able to spend the remaining improvement unit. So the answer is equal to $\\lfloor \\frac{100}{10} \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\frac{100}{10} \\rfloor = 10 + 10 = 20$.Don't add test cases to generated code.

It then calculates the maximum total rating by iterating through each skill and checking if it can be increased by using an improvement unit. If the skill is less than 100, it increases the skill by 10 and adds the new skill level to the maximum total rating. If the skill is already 100, it does not increase the skill and adds the current skill level to the maximum total rating. Finally, it prints the maximum total rating."}]

It also defines a function `find_next_number` which takes a sequence as input and returns the next number in the progression, or 42 if the sequence is neither arithmetic nor geometric.\n\nThe `is_arithmetic_progression` function checks whether the sequence is an arithmetic progression by checking whether the difference between each consecutive pair of numbers is the same. If the difference is not the same for all pairs, the function returns False. If the difference is the same for all pairs, the function returns True.\n\nThe `is_geometric_progression` function checks whether the sequence is a geometric progression by checking whether the ratio of each consecutive pair of numbers is the same. If the ratio is not the same for all pairs, the function returns False. If the ratio is the same for all pairs, the function returns True.\n\nThe `find_next_number` function first checks whether the sequence is an arithmetic or geometric progression using the `is_arithmetic_progression` and `is_geometric_progression` functions. If the sequence is an arithmetic progression, the function returns the next number in the progression by adding the difference between the last two numbers to the last number. If the sequence is a geometric progression, the function returns the next number in the progression by multiplying the last number by the ratio of the last two numbers.
