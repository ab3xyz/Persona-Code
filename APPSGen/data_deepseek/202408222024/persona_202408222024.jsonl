{"content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of possible game outcomes where Memory ends up with a strictly higher score than Lexa after \\( t \\) turns. Each turn, both players can add an integer between \\(-k\\) and \\(k\\) to their scores. The total number of possible games is \\((2k+1)^{2t}\\), but we are interested in the subset where Memory's final score is strictly higher than Lexa's.\n\nGiven the constraints, a direct simulation or brute force approach would be computationally infeasible due to the large number of possible outcomes. Instead, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to achieve each possible score difference after \\( t \\) turns.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n\n1. **Define the State:**\n   - Let \\( dp[i][j] \\) represent the number of ways to have a score difference of \\( j \\) after \\( i \\) turns.\n   - The score difference \\( j \\) can range from \\(-2kt\\) to \\(2kt\\) because in the worst case, one player could gain \\( kt \\) points and the other could lose \\( kt \\) points.\n\n2. **Initialization:**\n   - Initialize \\( dp[0][a-b] \\) to 1 because at the start, the score difference is \\( a - b \\).\n\n3. **Transition:**\n   - For each turn \\( i \\) from 1 to \\( t \\):\n     - For each possible score difference \\( j \\) from \\(-2kt\\) to \\(2kt\\):\n       - Update \\( dp[i][j] \\) by summing over all possible changes in score difference from the previous turn:\n         - \\( dp[i][j] = \\sum_{d=-k}^{k} dp[i-1][j-d] \\)\n\n4. **Result:**\n   - The number of games where Memory wins is the sum of \\( dp[t][j] \\) for all \\( j > 0 \\).\n\n5. **Modulo Operation:**\n   - Since the result can be very large, take the result modulo \\( 10^9 + 7 \\).\n\n### Implementation:\n\nHere is a Python-like pseudocode to illustrate the approach:\n\n```python\nMOD = 10**9 + 7\n\ndef count_winning_games(a, b, k, t):\n    max_diff = 2 * k * t\n    dp = [[0] * (2 * max_diff + 1) for _ in range(t + 1)]\n    dp[0][max_diff + (a - b)] = 1\n\n    for i in range(1, t + 1):\n        for j in range(-max_diff, max_diff + 1):\n            for d in range(-k, k + 1):\n                if -max_diff <= j - d <= max_diff:\n                    dp[i][max_diff + j] = (dp[i][max_diff + j] + dp[i - 1][max_diff + (j - d)]) % MOD\n\n    result = 0\n    for j in range(1, max_diff + 1):\n        result = (result + dp[t][max_diff + j]) % MOD\n\n    return result\n\n# Example usage:\na, b, k, t = 1, 2, 2, 1\nprint(count_winning_games(a, b, k, t))  # Output: 6\n```\n\nThis pseudocode outlines the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.
